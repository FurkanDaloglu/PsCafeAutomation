## Download the sql script and run it in your own sql. Edit the ConnectionString within the application according to your needs and enjoy the application.

# The application has been developed for a PlayStation lounge that includes 5 PlayStation consoles and 2 billiard tables. Within the application, you can enter records by selecting tables for either unlimited or timed sessions, and these records are listed. For timed sessions, records trigger a red warning when the time expires. For tables started in an unlimited session, the fee is calculated based on the elapsed time when the "Calculate" button is pressed, and you can close the tables at any time. While the tables are active, you can also add drinks to the bill by selecting the table and drinks. Based on the records, you can view the transactions made on a selected day and see the total revenue. You can access the drinks table to add or delete drinks. Please feel free to improve my application, which includes many more features.
